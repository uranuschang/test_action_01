# TA-Lib Everywhere

This project provides pre-compiled [TA-Lib](https://github.com/TA-Lib/ta-lib-python) (Technical Analysis Library) Python packages for various operating systems and Python versions. These wheel files allow you to install TA-Lib directly **without** compiling from source or having the TA-Lib C library pre-installed on your system.


## Acknowledgements

This project is based on these excellent open-source projects:

- [TA-Lib/ta-lib-python](https://github.com/TA-Lib/ta-lib-python) - Python wrapper for TA-Lib
- [cgohlke/talib-build](https://github.com/cgohlke/talib-build) - TA-Lib build tools


## Why Use TA-Lib Everywhere?

We are [FinLab](https://www.finlab.tw), a team of financial data scientists/engineers. We use TA-Lib in our daily work to develop trading strategies and analyze financial data. We created TA-Lib Everywhere to make it easier for everyone to use TA-Lib in their Python projects.

## Usage

After installation, you can import and use it just like the original TA-Lib:

```python
import talib
import numpy as np

# Create a sample price data
close = np.random.random(100)

# Calculate a simple moving average
sma = talib.SMA(close, timeperiod=10)
print(sma)
```
